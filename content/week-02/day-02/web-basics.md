### 1. Flexbox vs Grid Layout

| Feature | Flexbox | CSS Grid |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dimensions** | **1-Dimensional (1D):** Lays out elements in one direction at a time (rows **or** columns). | **2-Dimensional (2D):** Lays out elements in two directions simultaneously (rows **and** columns). |
| **Design Approach** | Content-first: Inner element contents determine their own size and layout space. | Layout-first: Define the structural grid first, then place elements inside the grid cells. |
| **Pros** | - Easy alignment of items along main/cross axes.<br>- Perfect for simpler, responsive linear components (e.g., Navbars, simple lists). | - Effortlessly handles complex layouts with overlapping items or multiple rows and columns.<br>- Built-in gap properties make spacing cells very easy. |
| **Cons** | Hard to align items across multiple distinct rows or columns. | Steeper initial learning curve; verbose code for simple designs. |

* **Decision Rule:**
  * Use **Flexbox** for individual components or layouts along a single axis (e.g., horizontal menu bars, vertical sidebars, inline buttons).
  * Use **Grid** for the overarching layout structure of the page or complex components (e.g., 3-column page layouts, dashboards, galleries).

### 2. Library vs Framework

The core difference between a Library and a Framework is **Inversion of Control (IoC)**.

* **Library:**
  * **Definition:** A collection of pre-written helper functions or modules that you call to perform specific tasks.
  * **Mechanism:** **You call the Library.** You control the flow, deciding when, where, and how to use it.
  * *Examples:* `React`, `Lodash`, `Axios`.
* **Framework:**
  * **Definition:** A pre-packaged scaffold or ecosystem with strict rules regarding folder structure, conventions, and runtime flow.
  * **Mechanism:** **The Framework calls you.** The framework dictates the structure, and it will execute your code at designated lifecycle hooks or routes.
  * *Examples:* `Next.js`, `Angular`, `NestJS`.

#### Next.js vs NestJS Comparison

Although they share similar names and both run in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, Next.js and NestJS are built for completely different purposes:

| Criteria | Next.js | NestJS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Purpose** | **Frontend & Fullstack Framework** (building user interfaces and client-side application flows). | **Backend Framework** (building robust APIs, microservices, and server-side logic). |
| **Underlying Library** | Built on top of **React**. | Built on top of **Express** or **Fastify** (using an OOP Modular structure inspired by Angular). |
| **Rendering Mechanism** | Supports SSR (Server-Side Rendering), SSG (Static Site Generation), and CSR (Client-Side Rendering). | Runs purely on the server-side, handling business logic; does not manage user interface rendering. |
| **Architecture** | File-system Routing (automatic route creation based on files/directories). | Module, Controller, and Provider/Service architecture (strictly enforcing Dependency Injection and Decorators). |

### 3. HTTP Status Codes

These codes are returned by servers to inform clients about the result of their HTTP requests.

| Group | Code | Name | Definition | Real-world Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1xx** (Info) | `101` | Switching Protocols | Upgrades the communication protocol. | Swapping HTTP to WebSocket for a real-time chat application. |
| **2xx** (Success)| `200` | OK | Request was successfully processed. | Fetching article list (GET) or updating user profile (PUT). |
| | `201` | Created | Resource was successfully created. | Registering a new account or creating an invoice (POST). |
| | `202` | Accepted | Request accepted for asynchronous processing. | Uploading a video to be compressed by the backend queue. |
| | `204` | No Content | Request succeeded but returns no response body. | Deleting a post from the database (DELETE). |
| **3xx** (Redirect)| `301` | Moved Permanently | Permanent redirection to a new URL. | Redirecting an old domain name to a new one. |
| | `302` | Found (Temp Redirect) | Temporary redirection. | Redirecting unauthenticated users to the `/login` page. |
| | `304` | Not Modified | Resource unchanged; client uses cached version. | Browser loading cached images to save user bandwidth. |
| **4xx** (Client Error)| `400` | Bad Request | Request contains bad syntax or parameters. | Sending a malformed JSON payload (missing bracket or extra comma). |
| | `401` | Unauthorized | Client identity is not authenticated. | Calling a protected API route without sending a Bearer Token. |
| | `403` | Forbidden | Authenticated but lacks access permissions. | A standard User account attempting to call Admin DELETE APIs. |
| | `404` | Not Found | Requested resource or API path could not be found. | Calling a non-existent API path or a deleted database item. |
| | `405` | Method Not Allowed | Incorrect HTTP method used on the route. | Sending a GET request to an endpoint configured only for POST. |
| | `409` | Conflict | Resource state conflict. | Registering a new user with an email already taken in the DB. |
| | `422` | Unprocessable Entity | Request validation failed. | Submitting a password that is too short or an invalid email format. |
| | `429` | Too Many Requests | Too many requests sent in a short time frame. | Spamming an API endpoint (blocked by Rate Limiting). |
| **5xx** (Server Error)| `500` | Internal Server Error | Generic backend server error. | Server code crashing due to uncaught runtime errors or DB failure. |
| | `502` | Bad Gateway | Gateway or proxy error. | Nginx failing to proxy request because the Node.js process died. |
| | `503` | Service Unavailable | Server temporarily overloaded or offline. | Server down due to an active maintenance window or high traffic spike. |
| | `504` | Gateway Timeout | Upstream server timed out. | Backend taking too long (e.g. generating a massive report) past gateway limits. |
